## Manual

`Left mouse button click on cell` opens it

`Right mouse button click on cell` places a flag

`Left mouse button click on a number` opens cells around it if enough flags were placed

`Right mouse button click on a number` places quantity of flags
equal to the number (it doesn't work if the number in the cell is less
then the quantity of the nearest cells)

## Supported Browsers

In general I support the latest two versions of major browsers like
Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. But this game can work with older
browsers, for instance in Internet Explorer 11.
