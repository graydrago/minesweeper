      <b>Left mouse button click on cell</b> opens it<br>
      <b>Right mouse button click on cell</b> places a flag<br>
      <b>Left mouse button click on a number</b> opens cells around it if enough flags were placed<br>
      <b>Right mouse button click on a number</b> places quantity of flags
      equal to the number (it doesn't work if the number in the cell is less
      then the quantity of the nearest cells)

    <h1>Supported Browsers</h1>
    <p>
      In general I support the latest two versions of major browsers like
      Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. But this game can work with older
      browsers, for instance in Internet Explorer 11.
